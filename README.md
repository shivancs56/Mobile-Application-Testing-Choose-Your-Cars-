Car User App Quality Assurance Report
1. Project Overview
This report details the Quality Assurance (QA) testing results for the Car User App. The objective was to identify and document critical bugs that impact the application's functionality, user interface, and performance.

2. Testing Scope
The testing process focused on three primary screens within the application:


Home/Search Screen: Evaluated car listing accuracy and search filters.


Product Detail Page: Verified the functionality of action buttons (Call, Share, Favorite).


User Profile Page: Checked the integrity of user identity data and legal content.

3. Reporting Methodology
Each identified issue is documented using a structured format to ensure clarity for the development team:


Steps to Reproduce: A clear sequence of actions to trigger the bug.


Expected vs. Actual Result: A comparison of intended behavior versus the current error.


Severity: Issues are categorized as High, Medium, or Low based on their impact on the user experience.

4. Summary of Key Findings
Critical Issues: Several "High Severity" functional bugs were found, including broken navigation links and incorrect user profile data.


Performance: Significant delays in data loading (30-40 seconds) were observed, which negatively affect usability.


UI/UX: Visual inconsistencies such as text-image overlapping were identified.
